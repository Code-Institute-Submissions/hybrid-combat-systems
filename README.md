# Hybrid Combat Systems Website

This is a website to showcase the Hybrid Combat Systems martial arts club. 
The club currently only has a facebook page and no website. This site will include 
images and video clips of club members in action as well as information on class
times and other items of relevance to current and prospective members.

## UX
The site has been created as a single page scrolling site with nav links to each section. 

Icons and text have been used in the nav to highlight the purpose of each section. 

### Design
The site has been graphically designed using the Hybrid Combat Systems color scheme. The black, red and white colors of the club lend themselves perfectly to a high contrast accesible design schema. These have been incorporated via white font on black backgrounds and red highlighting in headers and serve to reinforce the martial ethos of the club.
